                <p>Tomorrow I’ll be starting the Iron Yard boot camp for the .NET class. I’m very excited to start this new chapter in my life and I hope to come out of it with some valuable information. Prior to this, I haven’t had a lot of coding experience. I have practiced some HTML and CSS from dash.com. I have also worked a little bit from a Javascript book to become a bit more familiar with the programming syntax. The language I’ve spent the most time on is SQL and PL/SQL, for about a week. So far I feel pretty comfortable with the material and I’m read to start learning something new!</p>
